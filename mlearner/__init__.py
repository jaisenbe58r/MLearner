# On OSX, we can get a runtime error due to multiple OpenMP libraries loaded
# simultaneously. This can happen for instance when calling BLAS inside a
# prange. Setting the following environment variable allows multiple OpenMP
# libraries to be loaded. It should not degrade performances since we manually
# take care of potential over-subcription performance issues, in sections of
# the code where nested OpenMP loops can happen, by dynamically reconfiguring
# the inner OpenMP runtime to temporarily disable it while under the scope of
# the outer OpenMP parallel section.
